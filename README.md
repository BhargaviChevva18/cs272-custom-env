# Autonomous Driving Scenario
## Project Summary
<!-- Around 200 Words -->
<!-- Cover (1) What problem you are solving, (2) Who will use this RL module and be happy with the learning, and (3) a brief description of the results -->
A simulation of autonomous driving car, where the environment is a simple 2D grid with paths and blockers. The blockers can be stationary objects like trees and dynamic objects - other moving cars. The path is a three lane road where the agent has to reach a destination point. 

## State Space
<!-- See the Cart Pole Env example https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/ -->
The state of the environment consists of a 2D grid with a few possible paths and blockers.
